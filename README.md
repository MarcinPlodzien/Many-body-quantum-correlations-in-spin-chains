These notes are Supplementary Materials [...] presenting a way for analytical derivation of the correlator detecting many-body Bell correlations generated during the One-Axis Twisting protocol.

Repo contains:

 1. Mathematica script for analytical calculations of the many-body Bell correlations generated during one-axis twisting protocol
 2. A PDF file with plots and analytical formulas
