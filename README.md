# Many-body-quantum-correlations-in-spin-chains
This notes are Suplementar Materials [...] presenting a way for analytical derivation of the correlator detecting many-body Bell correlations generated during One-Axis Twisting protocol.

Repo contains:
1. Mathematica script for analytical calculations of the many-body Bell correlations generated during one-axis twisting protocol
2. PDF file with plots and analytical formulas
